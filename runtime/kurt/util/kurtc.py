"""Currently broken. TODO: fix

Scratch project  <--->  folder structure of scripts and images

Usage: kurtc.py decompile "path/to/file.sb"
       kurtc.py compile "path/to/project files/"

decompile: scratch project  -> folder structure with project contents
compile:   folder structure -> scratch project

Folder structure: (most subfolders are optional)
    00 Stage/                 [each sprite has its own directory]
        backgrounds/
        ...
    01 Sprite 1/
        costumes/             [export to PNG or JPG format files, 
            01 costume1.png              import from most formats]
            02 costume2.jpg
            ...
        costumes.txt          [costume details, rotation centers]
        lists/                [.txt file for each list, one item per line]
